    """Performs feature selection based on the given operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    profiles : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame or file
        DataFrame or file of profiles.
    features : list
        A list of strings corresponding to feature measurement column names in the
        `profiles` DataFrame. All features listed must be found in `profiles`.
        Defaults to "infer". If "infer", then assume cell painting features are those
        prefixed with "Cells", "Nuclei", or "Cytoplasm".
    image_features: bool, default False
        Whether the profiles contain image features.
    samples : list or str, default "all"
        Samples to provide operation on.
    operation: list of str or str, default "variance_threshold
        Operations to perform on the input profiles.
    output_file : str, optional
        If provided, will write feature selected profiles to file. If not specified, will
        return the feature selected profiles as output. We recommend that this output file be
        suffixed with "_normalized_variable_selected.csv".
    output_type : str, optional
        If provided, will write feature selected profiles as a specified file type (either CSV or parquet).
        If not specified and output_file is provided, then the file will be outputed as CSV as default.
    na_cutoff : float, default 0.05
        Proportion of missing values in a column to tolerate before removing.
    corr_threshold : float, default 0.9
        Value between (0, 1) to exclude features above if any two features are correlated above this threshold.
    corr_method : str, default "pearson"
        Correlation type to compute. Allowed methods are "spearman", "kendall" and "pearson".
    freq_cut : float, default 0.05
        Ratio (2nd most common feature val / most common). Must range between 0 and 1.
        Remove features lower than freq_cut. A low freq_cut will remove features
        that have large difference between the most common feature and second most
        common feature. (e.g. this will remove a feature: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0.01, 0.01, ...])
    unique_cut: float, default 0.01
        Ratio (num unique features / num samples). Must range between 0 and 1.
        Remove features less than unique cut. A low unique_cut will remove features
        that have very few different measurements compared to the number of samples.
    compression_options : str or dict, optional
        Contains compression options as input to
        pd.DataFrame.to_csv(compression=compression_options). pandas version >= 1.2.
    float_format : str, optional
        Decimal precision to use in writing output file as input to
        pd.DataFrame.to_csv(float_format=float_format). For example, use "%.3g" for 3
        decimal precision.
    blocklist_file : str, optional
        File location of datafrmame with with features to exclude. Note that if "blocklist" in operation then will remove standard blocklist
    outlier_cutoff : float, default 500
        The threshold at which the maximum or minimum value of a feature across a full experiment is excluded. Note that this procedure is typically applied after normalization.
    noise_removal_perturb_groups: str or list of str, optional
        Perturbation groups corresponding to rows in profiles or the the name of the metadata column containing this information.
    noise_removal_stdev_cutoff: float,optional
        Maximum mean feature standard deviation to be kept for noise removal, grouped by the identity of the perturbation from perturb_list. The data must already be normalized so that this cutoff can apply to all columns.

    Returns
    -------
    selected_df : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame, optional
        The feature selected profile DataFrame. If output_file=None, then return the
        DataFrame. If you specify output_file, then write to file and do not return
        data.
