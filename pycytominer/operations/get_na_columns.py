    Parameters
    ----------
    population_df : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
        DataFrame that includes metadata and observation features.
    features : list, default "infer"
         List of features present in the population dataframe [default: "infer"]
         if "infer", then assume cell painting features are those that start with
         "Cells_", "Nuclei_", or "Cytoplasm_".
    samples : str, default "all"
        List of samples to perform operation on. The function uses a pd.DataFrame.query()
        function, so you should  structure samples in this fashion. An example is
        "Metadata_treatment == 'control'" (include all quotes).
        If "all", use all samples to calculate.
    cutoff : float
        Exclude features that have a certain proportion of missingness

    Returns
    -------
    excluded_features : list of str
         List of features to exclude from the population_df.
