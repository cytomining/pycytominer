    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will set up the expected input and output paths that will be generated throughout this walkthrough. Let's take a look at the explanation of these inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workflow, we have two main inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **plate_data** (SQLite file): This contains the quantified single-cell morphology features that we'll be working with.\n",
    "- **plate_map** (CSV file): This contains additional information related to the cells, providing valuable context of our single-cell morphology dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore the outputs generated in this workflow. In this walkthrough, we will be generating four profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sc_profiles_path**: This refers to the single-cell morphology profile that will be generated.\n",
    "- **anno_profiles_path**: This corresponds to the annotated single-cell morphology profile, meaning the information from the **plate_map** is added to each single-cell\n",
    "- **norm_profiles_path**: This represents the normalized single-cell morphology profile.\n",
    "- **feat_profiles_path**: Lastly, this refers to the selected features from the single-cell morphology profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: All profiles are outputted as `.csv` files, however, users can output these files as `parquet` or other file file formats. \n",
    "For more information about output formats, please refer the documentation [here](https://pycytominer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pycytominer.cyto_utils.html#pycytominer.cyto_utils.output.output) \n",
    "\n",
    "These profiles will serve as important outputs that will help us analyze and interpret the single-cell morphology data effectively. Now that we have a clear understanding of the inputs and outputs, let's proceed further in our walkthrough."

    "\n",
    "In this section of the walkthrough, our goal is to load the NF1 dataset and create a merged single-cell morphology dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the NF1 dataset is stored in an `sqlite` format, where each table represents a different compartment, such as Image, Cell, Nucleus, and Cytoplasm.\n",
    "To achieve this, we will utilize the SingleCells class, which offers a range of functionalities specifically designed for single-cell analysis. You can find detailed documentation on these functionalities [here](https://pycytominer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pycytominer.cyto_utils.html#pycytominer.cyto_utils.cells.SingleCells).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Updating defaults\n",
    "Before we proceed further, it is important to update the default parameters in the `SingleCells`class to accommodate the table name changes in our NF1 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the table names in our NF1 dataset differ from the default table names recognized by the `SingleCells` class, we need to make adjustments to ensure proper recognition of these table name changes."
